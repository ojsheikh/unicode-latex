# Unicode Latex for vscode

A visual studio code extension that allows the insertion of unicode symbols from the latex names of those symbols. The list of symbols is currently generated from the Julia programming language's REPL's latex completions.

## Usage

To insert a symbol, simply execute the `Unicode: Insert Math Symbol` command and type in the name of your desired symbol or select it from the drop-down list.
